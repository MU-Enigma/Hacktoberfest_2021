# Ronika's Pattern discovery
Ronika is a pretty intelligent and creative girl who loves patterns. She loves coding, and loves to solve problems too. One day she was going through various patterns in C programming language. While playing around with various variables and print statements, she encountered a beautiful pattern after changing only one line in one of her pattern forming program. Can you figure out that **"one line"** which Ronika changed to get the following pattern?

 Ronika has already provided you with her original file. Make sure you change only **one line** in that file to get the above pattern.
 You get a smiley emoji pattern along with a free acceptance of your PR if you figure it out. So, do give it a try ! It is easy.

 PS: Maintainers, check for only **one line change** !!!!
