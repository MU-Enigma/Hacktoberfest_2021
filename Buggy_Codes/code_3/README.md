# WORD AREA Buggy Problem

Mrs. Shirley would like to find the area of a particular word, the heights of the 26 letters of the alphabet are given in an array of size 26.
For example an array = [1,3,1,3,1,4,1,3,2,5,5,5,5,1,1,5,5,1,5,2,5,5,5,5,5,5]
word = "bed"
The heights of b = 1, e = 1, d = 3.The tallest letter is d with a height of 3 and the word has 3 letters, so the area of the word is 3*3 (since max height) * (Number of Letters).
