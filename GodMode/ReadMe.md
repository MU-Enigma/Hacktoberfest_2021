In this part of the repo you are free to choose any language of choice to parallelize any algorithm you like . The output must include the run time for parallelized code along with no. of threads it used by the process.

```md
Multi-thread run time: 4.169s
```

Here are some refernces you could go through to know about some libraries

## Note

Your PR will only be accepted if your parallelized code is faster than your linear code
