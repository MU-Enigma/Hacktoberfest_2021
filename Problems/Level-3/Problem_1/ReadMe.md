# Indira vs Mr No Brains

After her recent breakup, Indira has taken a resolution that she won't give her phone number to any guy who is not good at programming in C/C++. She is going to be ruthless about this.

The other day when Mr No-Brains approached her to ask for her phone number, she replied as follows:

1. My mobile number has ten digits.

2. Begins with 93 and ends with 86.

3. Take the number n = 1234.56789 and raise it to a suitable power r. If you are sincere, you will find the correct value of r and evaluate n^r without approximations. You should find my number right after the decimal point.

Can you help Mr No-Brains find Indira's number?

Constraints:
0 < r < 1000
