## Problem 2

Ravi and Anirudh are best friends and both stay in room 316 New BH. They usually challenge each other to wake up early in the morning.

Let A(1), A(2), A(3)... A(N) be an array of N numbers. Where max(A(1) - A(2), A(2) - A(3), ... , A(n-1) - A(n)) represents the weekness of the given array. Ravi needs to find a permutation of a given array such that the resulting weakness is minimum possible.

Since Ravi is busy with his project work he asked you to find the solution.


Input:

First line, it contain a single integer N, the number of elements in the array.

Second line, it contains N space spearated integers A(i).


Output:

For each test case print a permutation of array such that weakness is minimised.


Test Case:

Input:
```
3
3 3 3
```
Output:
```
3 3 3```

Input:
```
3
1 3 2
```
Output:```
1 2 3```
