# Problem 7

```md
Rishi was not able to sleep. So, he started staring at the clock until he felt asleep. As he was observing, he noticed clock's hand and started thinking 'How many times will they pass each other before I nod off?' hh:mm. Now, you need to figure out how manu times clock's hands overlap from 00:00 to hh:mm(you must include 00:00 and hh:mm).
```

## Input Format

```md
You'll obtain a time in the hh:mm format on the first and only line.
0 ≤ h ≤ 23
0 ≤ m ≤ 59
```

## Sample Input

```c
3
01:05
08:36
03:16
```

## Sample Output

```c
