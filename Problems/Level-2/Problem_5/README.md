# Problem 5
Given a string S, check whether it is palindrome or not while only considering the alphanumeric characters and ignoring the case and also the spaces in between the words. Print "1" if it is a palindrome and "0" if it isn't.

(A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as "madam" or "level")

Example: S = "Race Car"

Here when we ignore the case and space and only consider alphanumeric characters, the string "Race Car" is equivalent to "racecar", which is a palindrome.
